# Known pitfalls of the hybrid layer (stage 1)

Things that cost time while loading an original Win32 executable over
`win32_layer`. Referenced from `SKILL.md`, stage 1. Add new ones under the game
that found them.

## From ArmyMen2

- 64-bit host types: the port targets i386 deliberately (`-m32`), because
  the original assumes 4-byte pointers and `long == 32`. Stay 32-bit for the
  hybrid. Use `<stdint.h>` fixed-width types in reconstructed code.
- Calling conventions: the image's functions are `__cdecl`, `__stdcall`,
  `__fastcall` or bare register conventions. Layer exports must match
  (`callconv.h`, `WINAPI`). A mismatched `stdcall`/`cdecl` corrupts the stack
  one call later, far from the cause.
- Some call sites reach a function with **no argument frame** (a stubbed
  logger folded onto a bare `ret`). Validate pointers before using them.
- Detours: copy a whole instruction boundary (>= 5 bytes), `jmp` back,
  and leave the original body running, so the original stays the oracle.
- Patched retail builds exist (GOG removes or alters code). Patch back only
  when the expected byte is found, and say so when it is not.

## Found booting a second game (Commandos)

- **Where the ELF goes.** It shares the address space with the PE *and* with
  the layer's fixed heap (`0x0C000000-0x16000000`). ArmyMen2's `0x700000` hits
  a big PE; `0x10000000` hits the heap (`fixedheap: cannot map the heap at
  0xc000000: File exists`). Link at `0x30000000` (clear of both, leaves
  brk's ASLR slack). Re-derive from `SizeOfImage` and the layer's constants.
- **`GetProcAddress` must answer NULL for what is not there.** The MSVC 7+
  CRT (`_mtinit`) probes `FlsAlloc/FlsFree/FlsGetValue/FlsSetValue` and falls
  back to `Tls*` only on NULL. A trap that answers non-NULL makes it call a
  function that is not there (symptom: a call to `0x00000000` from the CRT).
  The layer claims Windows 98 SE, which has no `Fls*`. Check which CRT the
  exe was built with by reading its startup, not by assuming the 1998 one: a
  re-released exe (GOG 2018 here) can be a modern rebuild.
- **Many imports are one-liners the layer already had.** Before writing a
  function, check whether it is implemented but missing from the export table.
- **Two stubs for the same name are a bug**; `w32l_export_lookup` falls
  through to `w32l_stub_lookup` only after the table.
